Vibe Coder Deployable Architecture - FAQ & Documentation

What is This?

This project is a simple Deployable Architecture for IBM Cloud that allows you to quickly deploy a static website by pasting your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly into a text field.

It provisions an IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) instance and a public bucket configured for static website hosting. It then uploads your code as an index.html file, making it instantly available via a public URL. The entire process is designed to be completed in just a few clicks.

While the project uses satirical and humorous language ("vibe," "synergy") in its configuration files, its core function is a straightforward and practical tool for developers, students, and hobbyists who need a quick way to host a static site for free.

How to Use

Deploying your website is a simple, two-step process within the IBM Cloud catalog.

Prerequisites:

An IBM Cloud account with a Lite plan.

Deployment Steps:

Navigate to the "Vibe Coder Landing Zone" tile in the IBM Cloud Catalog.

Review the configuration and paste your code into the Vibe Code input field.

Vessel Name (COS Instance): A name for the underlying Object Storage service. The default is usually fine.

Vibe Bucket Name (Prefix): A unique name for your storage bucket. A random suffix is added to prevent naming conflicts.

Resource Group: The resource group for deployment. The default is recommended.

Vibe Resonance Region: The physical location where your site will be hosted.

Vibe Code: Paste your complete HTML file content here. Inline CSS (<style>) and JavaScript (<script>) are supported.

Click Deploy. After a minute or two, the deployment will complete, and you will find your public URL in the "Outputs" section of the deployment details.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q: Is this really free?
A: Yes. The architecture is configured to use the IBM Cloud Object Storage Lite plan, which is always free and does not require a credit card. It has generous limits suitable for personal projects, portfolios, and prototypes.

Q: What kind of code can I deploy?
A: You can deploy any standard static web content. This includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All code must be contained within a single HTML file, as the tool creates one index.html file from your pasted input.

Q: How do I update my website?
A: There are two ways to update your site:

Re-deploy: Go to your deployment in the IBM Cloud dashboard, edit the configuration with your new code, and apply the changes.

Manual Upload: Navigate to your Cloud Object Storage bucket in the IBM Cloud dashboard and manually upload a new version of the index.html file.

Q: I see some strange markdown files in my bucket like PLAN.md. What are those?
A: These files (PLAN.md, PROGRESS.md, SYNERGY_REALIZED.md) are part of the project's satirical theme and are generated automatically during deployment. They serve as a humorous "audit trail." They have no functional impact on your website and can be safely ignored or deleted.

Q: What happens if I don't paste any code?
A: The architecture will still create the Cloud Object Storage instance and the bucket, but no index.html will be created. A default placeholder HTML page is included to ensure the deployment always results in a working (if simple) page.

Q: How do I delete the website and all its resources?
A: Navigate to your deployed architectures in the IBM Cloud dashboard, find your Vibe Coder deployment, and select the "Delete" action. This will automatically de-provision and delete all the resources that were created (the COS instance and bucket).

Technical Details

This architecture provisions the following IBM Cloud resources:

1 x IBM Cloud Object Storage Instance: The service that provides storage.

1 x IBM Cloud Object Storage Bucket: The specific container for your website files. The bucket is configured with a public access policy and is enabled for "Static Website Hosting."

1 x IBM Cloud Object Storage Object: The index.html file created from your vibe_code input.
